Welcome to my thesis code repository!
All work here should be considered WIP until April 14th, 2023. 
As such, code may not have comments or explanations. 

This repository accompanies my thesis report, which can be found at [Link coming soon!]

USAGE
------------
To run the simulated social media + algorithms program, download each of the three .java files (Main.java, User.java, Post.java) 
into the src folder of a new Java project in your IDE of choice. Uncommenting lines 39 and 40 and running the project should generate 
data files for the simulation.

(NOTE: These data files total around 750MB of data. Please ensure that you have that much space or more on your computer before running.)

After running the simulation, download the Thesis_charts.Rmd file, and open it in Rstudio. Replace the file paths (lines 28-37)
with the appropriate file paths in your computer, then run the file. This should generate analysis graphs and data that should match up
closely with the report.
